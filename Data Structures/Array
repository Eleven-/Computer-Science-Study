// Array is a data structure used to store elements of one type at contiguous locations
// Size is required before storing data

/*
Let size of array be n.

Task            Big-O     Reasoning

Accessing Time: O(1)      [This is possible because elements are stored at contiguous locations]

Search Time:    O(n)      for Sequential Search
            
                O(log n)  for Binary search [if array is **sorted**]
             
Insertion Time: O(n)      [The worst case occurs when insertion happens at the beginning of array and requires shifting all elements]

Deletion Time:  O(n)      [The worst case occurs when deletion happens at the beginning of an array and requires shifting all elements]
